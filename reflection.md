# Reflection


Did I accomplished in my "needs to have" list?
- I accomplished most of needs to have list.
- The only thing that I didn't accomplish was create mini map. 

What was the hardest challenges for me?
- One of the hardest challenges was created hit area of player and enemies, I tried to get the 
distance of the sprite and attack to use dist(), but it was hard to get the correct distance. 
- Also, make enemy follow player was the hard challenges for me.
- To accomplished those, I also used little bit of physics engine.

Problems that I couldn't solve yet
- Sometimes, the player sprite disappear for a moment after player move. 
- The boss attack damage area was larger than it should be.
